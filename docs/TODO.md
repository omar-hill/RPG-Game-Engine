- [ ] Review `TermsOfService` model ‚Äì confirm schema consistency
- [ ] Add `/tos/update` route (admin-only)
- [ ] Add `/status` route to confirm backend health
- [ ] Test all endpoints with `curl` + Postman collection

## üóÑÔ∏è PHASE 3: DATABASE (PostgreSQL)
**Goal:** Ensure database resilience, security, and data integrity.

- [ ] Verify DB credentials in `.env`  
      - postgres user: `Admin`

- [ ] Enable daily dump/backup script
- [ ] Add index for fast search on usernames
- [ ] Document migration steps for version upgrades

---

## üìò PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION (GitHub Docs)
**Goal:** Full transparency and repeatable deployment process.

- [ ] Verify all five docs exist:
  - [x] `README.md`
  - [x] `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
  - [x] `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - [ ] `TODO.md`
  - [ ] `DEVELOPER_NOTES.md` *(next file to generate)*
- [ ] Ensure all guides use exact commands, not summaries
- [ ] Include version control notes (branching workflow)
- [ ] Add contribution rules (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- [ ] Include `CHANGELOG.md` for updates

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 5: AUTOMATION / DEVOPS
**Goal:** Eliminate manual restart and setup waste.

- [ ] Combine backend + frontend start scripts into one file if not done (`start_all.sh`)
- [ ] Auto-detect and kill ports 8000 + 5173 before restart
- [ ] Add version check for Python / Node / PostgreSQL
- [ ] Add `check_env.sh` to confirm environment readiness
- [ ] Create `update.sh` for pulling latest Git commits safely

---

## üß© PHASE 6: QUALITY & TESTING
**Goal:** Verify every function and endpoint before deployment.

- [ ] Unit tests for all API routes
- [ ] UI functional test: ToS modal opens and scrolls
- [ ] Database connectivity test (`pytest` or manual SQL)
- [ ] Confirm no open ports remain after stop scripts
- [ ] Validate cross-browser (Chrome / Firefox)
- [ ] End-to-end test: Register ‚Üí Login ‚Üí View ToS
- [ ] Confirm startup logs correctly in `server_events.log`

---

## üßæ PHASE 7: DEPLOYMENT / RELEASE
**Goal:** Make production-ready version under `main` branch.

- [ ] Tag initial release: `v1.0-beta`
- [ ] Push documentation to GitHub
- [ ] Test GitHub clone on clean system
- [ ] Verify ngrok tunnel publicly accessible
- [ ] Add deployment instructions for self-hosting (optional)
- [ ] Monitor performance + DB load for optimization

---

## üîí PHASE 8: FUTURE ROADMAP (NEXT SPRINT)
**Goal:** Plan for post-MVP improvements.

- [ ] Implement character creation system
